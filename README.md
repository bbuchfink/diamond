# DIAMOND
DIAMOND is a BLAST-compatible local aligner for mapping translated DNA query sequences against a protein reference database (BLASTX alignment mode). The speedup over BLAST is up to 20,000 on short reads at a typical sensitivity of 90-99% relative to BLAST depending on the data and settings.
