**DIAMOND v0.7.3 by Benjamin Buchfink** - http://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond

DIAMOND is a BLAST-compatible local aligner for mapping protein and translated DNA query sequences against a protein reference database (BLASTP and BLASTX alignment mode). The speedup over BLAST is up to 20,000 on short reads at a typical sensitivity of 90-99% relative to BLAST depending on the data and settings.
